# TOY EXAMPLE

This is a repository containing the files Jared sent me to run the SEM_PGS model

It is very well annotated (!) by Jared and inputs: \
    - Yo:  The offspring's phenotypic value \
    - Yp:  The father's phenotypic value \
    - Ym:  The mother's phenotypic value \
    - Tp:  A PGS made from the TRANSMITTED portion of the PATERNAL genotype \
    - Tm:  A PGS made from the TRANSMITTED portion of the MATERNAL genotype \
    - NTp: A PGS made from the NON-TRANSMITTED portion of the PATERNAL genotype \
    - NTm: A PGS made from the NON-TRANSMITTED portion of the MATERNAL genotype \
