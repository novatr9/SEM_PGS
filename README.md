# SEM_PGS

### This is a repository containing the workflow for multivariate SEM_PG

This README file provides information re background and versions of the pipeline. 

The current version of directory will host all scripts of the pipeline being used for quality control, partitioning of transmitted and non transmitted nucleotides and calculation of polygenic scores for simulated and then empirical data.
Briefly, the pipeline takes care of *insert here steps, in shape of a table?bullet points?* etc. between Discovery and Target samples, and calculation of final scores. 



This directory is temporary and being improved, and a more generic version of pipeline / container for customizable genetic data and non-cloud based environment will be added.
